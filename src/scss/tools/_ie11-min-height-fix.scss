 * IE11 only fix: when you want to align something vertically with flexbox, but
 * the element has a min-height and no height property, then the alignment won't
 * work. To make the alignment without setting a height work with min-height,
 * an after element is placed which makes sure the content within can be
 * aligned. ONLY USE THIS FOR IE11!
